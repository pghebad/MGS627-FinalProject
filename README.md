# MGS627-FinalProject
This project aims to help people decide whether to buy or rent a property by analyzing key data points like price, size, bedrooms, and rent estimates.
 Real estate decisions often involve multiple factors, and this project uses Python to simplify and analyze these details. Python helps clean and process the data, visualize trends, and uncover patterns that are hard to see otherwise.
We use a regression model to predict rent estimates based on factors such as property price, living area, and the number of bedrooms. This model helps understand which factors have the biggest impact on rent and whether buying or renting is a better financial choice.  
For example, we explore trends like rent-to-price ratios, the average price based on bedrooms, and how property size affects cost. 
With visualizations like scatter plots and bar charts, the data becomes easier to interpret. Python's tools make this process faster and more efficient, turning raw data into meaningful insights. Overall, this project gives users a clear way to make smart, data-driven decisions about real estate.
